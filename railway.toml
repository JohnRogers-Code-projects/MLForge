# Railway Configuration Template for ModelForge
#
# NOTE: This root railway.toml is provided as documentation/template ONLY.
# Railway configuration for actual services is defined in:
#   - backend/railway.toml       (FastAPI API service)
#   - backend/railway.worker.toml (Celery worker service)
#   - frontend/railway.toml      (Next.js frontend service)
#
# Keeping configuration service-specific avoids ambiguity about
# which service a given setting (e.g., health checks, replicas)
# applies to.
#
# Example configuration snippet (for reference only):
#
# [build]
# builder = "DOCKERFILE"
# dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"
#
# [deploy]
# restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
# restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
# healthcheckPath = "/api/v1/health"
# healthcheckTimeout = 30
# numReplicas = 1
